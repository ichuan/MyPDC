what is PDC ?
=============

PDC == Personal Data Center

see http://mypdc.info/ for more


Install
=======

After you get this source file, check the install/ dir, there's a `apache.conf` file for the web server.
Along in that folder, there is a `postgres.sql` file for you to create a postgresql database.
Then run install.sh in that folder to init the web folder

There're 2 sample config file in application/configs/, remember to copy and rename them to application.php and config.php

Because ZendFramework is so big, it isn't included in MyPDC, you have to download it from http://zendframework.com/download/latest, and unarchive it to library/Zend directory

Sorry for so little install instructions here, feel free to concat me in case any problems encontered.
